            <p>I started to have interest in coding when i was 12 years old. I always had interests in making websites. I started web development through an interest in creating interactive and visually appealing websites. I learned HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and still I am learning.</p>

          <h3>Dance</h3>
          <p>I started dancing at a young age and discovered a passion for it. I took classes, performed, and dance became a central part of my life. It provides self-expression and continues to bring joy and fulfillment.</p>
